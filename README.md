# SE329 Fall 2015 Final Project

#####Team Members
* Jonathan Osborne
* Anish Kunduru
* Kellen Johnson

#####Chosen System
* For this project we used Kayak.com as a template. The reason this site was chosen is because of the different stakeholders involved. Primarily with respect to packages. This feature of Kayak allows users to compare different travel deals from other booking services such as Priceline or Orbitz.
